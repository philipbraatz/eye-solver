The goal of this project is to let a neural network play any game on your screen with constant view of a score.

The first time you start it you should not load a network because you have to train one first. after training a network you will be able to load it in the menu and train it or test it.

Pruning a network simplifies it while maintaining what it learned.
  -Disables weights that are near zero
